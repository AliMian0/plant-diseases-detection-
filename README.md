Introducing your Plant Disease Detection System!
This innovative system empowers you to identify potential diseases affecting your plants with ease.  Simply upload a clear picture of your plant, and the system will analyze the image to detect signs of illness.

Here's how it works:

Upload an Image:  Take a close-up photo of the affected area of your plant, ensuring good lighting and clear focus. Upload the image through the system's user interface.
